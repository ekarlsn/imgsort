# Tool to sort manually sort images

The tool will allow you to tag images as you browse through them, and then move them into a specific subfolder based on the tags you've assigned to them.
It's meant to load images really fast. It's not meant to be a full fledged image viewer.

## Usage

Run it in the folder you want to sort images
